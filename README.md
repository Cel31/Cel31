## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Celine

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the FAIR Phytolith Project
I carried out fieldwork in Taiwan and Philippines for my PhD research on basket making. I am using a participant-observation approach to learn about the raw materials, techniques, technology, and purposes of basket making. I aim to learn how practitioners assess the properties or qualities of the materials they use, and how the materials are related to end products and uses.

My personal research concerns the study of plant physical properties and the identification of plant-based technology found in archaeological contexts.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
- how to use open science tools
- how to make baskets from plant-based raw materials and plastics,
- how to create compost and bokashi compost from trash!

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaboration around sustainability and responsible science
